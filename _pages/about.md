I'm a rising senior at UC Davis, majoring in Statistics and minoring in Managerial Economics. I also serve as the Financial Operation Executive for [**iidata**](http://www.iidata.net/), the first student-run Data Science Convention, located in UC Davis.

This blog is a dedication for my interests including Statistics, Data Science and Analysis, Technology and Culture.
