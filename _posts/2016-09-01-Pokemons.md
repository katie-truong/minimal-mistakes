When it comes to Pokemons, there are 18 different types of Pokemons. Types such as Poison and Water populate the first generations, when types such as Dark and Dragon tend to appear mostly in later generations.  There are also two big sorts of Pokemons: the single ones (pokemons of only one type) and the dual ones (pokemons with two types). The majority of starter pokemons (except for Bulbasaur and Charmander) tend to be of single type, while many pokemons later in the game tend to be of dual types. However, there are exceptions, such as Dragonite which appeared in the first generation, or Mewtwo and one of its elvolved state, MewtwoMega Mewtwo Y, are of pure single type. So what is the secret behind the type of Pokemons as well as the Single and Dual mechanism of pokemons? In this post, I would use the Hadley Wickham's packages (`dplyr` and `tidyr`) along with `ggplot2` to analyze and visualize a Pokemon dataset to answer questions:

1. What type of pokemons can be considered the best?
2. Are single type pokemons or dual type pokemons are more likely to be better?

## Preliminary steps

First, we need to load the file from the source, and load all the libraries we would use in the analysis:

```
pokemons_wide <- read.csv("Pokemon.csv")
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(scales)
```

Using the `str` function for the dataset, we can see the very clean and straightforward structure of the dataset:

```
str(pokemons_wide)

'data.frame':	800 obs. of  13 variables:
 $ X.        : int  1 2 3 3 4 5 6 6 6 7 ...
 $ Name      : Factor w/ 800 levels "Abomasnow","AbomasnowMega Abomasnow",..: 81 330 746 747 103 104 100 101 102 666 ...
 $ Type.1    : Factor w/ 18 levels "Bug","Dark","Dragon",..: 10 10 10 10 7 7 7 7 7 18 ...
 $ Type.2    : Factor w/ 19 levels "","Bug","Dark",..: 15 15 15 15 1 1 9 4 9 1 ...
 $ Total     : int  318 405 525 625 309 405 534 634 634 314 ...
 $ HP        : int  45 60 80 80 39 58 78 78 78 44 ...
 $ Attack    : int  49 62 82 100 52 64 84 130 104 48 ...
 $ Defense   : int  49 63 83 123 43 58 78 111 78 65 ...
 $ Sp..Atk   : int  65 80 100 122 60 80 109 130 159 50 ...
 $ Sp..Def   : int  65 80 100 120 50 65 85 85 115 64 ...
 $ Speed     : int  45 60 80 80 65 80 100 100 100 43 ...
 $ Generation: int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ Legendary : Factor w/ 2 levels "False","True": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 
```

 
 The dataset has 800 rows (yes, 800 different pokemons!) with 13 basic variables including their IDs, names, types, stats, generation and whether if they are legendary pokemons or not. Looking at the source, each column is explained as followed:
 
 
    #: ID for each pokemon
    Name: Name of each pokemon
    Type 1: Each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks
    Type 2: Some pokemon are dual type and have 2
    Total: sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is
    HP: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting
    Attack: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)
    Defense: the base damage resistance against normal attacks
    SP Atk: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)
    SP Def: the base damage resistance against special attacks
    Speed: determines which pokemon attacks first each round

We can notice that there are many empty Type.2 in the dataset. These are single-type pokemons. We can sort the pokemons into these two types by using the `ifelse` function:


```
pokemons_wide$Sort <- ifelse(pokemons_data$Type.2 == "", "Single", "Dual")
```

Another step we should do is to melt **Type.1** and **Type.2** into one column as **Type** for easier analysis in the next section and rearrange the dataset into a nice, usable format. We can achieve that easily by using `dplyr` and `tidyr`:

```
# Sort into Single or Dual Type
pokemons_wide$Sort <- ifelse(pokemons_data$Type.2 == "", "Single", "Dual")

# Melt Type1 and Type2 into Type
pokemons_long <- gather(pokemons_wide, Category, Type, 
                   Type.1, Type.2, factor_key = T)

# Convert to tbl_df
pokemons_long <- tbl_df(pokemons)

# Deselect the empty type 2
pokemons_long <- filter(pokemons_long, Type != "")

# Order by Poke number
pokemons_long <- pokemons_long[order(pokemons_long$X., pokemons_long$Category), ]

# Select usable columns
pokemons_long <- select(pokemons_long, X., Name, Type, Category, Sort, Total:Legendary)
```

Which would give us a nice, clean long dataframe of 1214 rows and 14 columns:

```
> pokemons_long

7               Venusaur Poison   Dual   525    80     82      83     100     100    80          1     False
8  VenusaurMega Venusaur Poison   Dual   625    80    100     123     122     120    80          1     False
9             Charmander   Fire Single   309    39     52      43      60      50    65          1     False

```

In this analysis, we would be working on both the origional **pokemons_wide** and the gathered format **pokemons_long**, depends on the task we are doing. For the purpose of this analysis, I would refer to "Single" and "Dual" as "sort", to differ with 18 main types.

## Summary stats by type:

We can get a summary of all the statistics given in the dataset per type easily in one chain function:

```
summaryStats_byType <- group_by(pokemons_long, Type) %>%
                       summarise(Count = n(),
                                 AverageTotal = mean(Total, na.rm = T),
                                 AverageHP = mean(HP, na.rm = T),
                                 AverageAttack = mean(Attack, na.rm = T),
                                 AverageDefense = mean(Defense, na.rm = T),
                                 AverageSpAtk = mean(Sp..Atk, na.rm = T),
                                 AverageSpDef = mean(Sp..Def, na.rm = T),
                                 AverageSpeed = mean(Speed, na.rm = T),
                                 AverageGeneration = mean(Generation, na.rm = T),
                                 LegendaryCount = sum(as.character(Legendary)=="True"))
```

Which gives us a nice 18x11 data frame that would suffice enough for our analysis:

```
With `ggplot2`, we can get a bar chart of all the number of pokemons per type, using the code below:

```
gg1 <- ggplot(summaryStats_byType, 
              aes(x = reorder(Type, Count), y = Count)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "dodgerblue3") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Count)),
            color = "white", hjust = 1.2, vjust = 0.3) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("") +
  guides(fill=FALSE) +
  ggtitle("The number of pokemons in each type") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=20))
```

**IMAGE 1**

With Type 1 and Type 2 combined, we can see that Water is the most popular type of pokemons with 126 pokemons, while Ice is the least popular type of pokemons with only 36 pokemons. Pretty ironic, right? (Isn't ice also water?). Normal and Flying are the second and third most popular types, while Fairy and Ghost are the second and third rarest. 

## What type of Pokemons is the most powerful?

If Ice, Fairy and Ghost are the rarest pokemons, does it mean that they are the most powerful ones? Not quite. However, we have a point to say that rare pokemons are powerful pokemons: Dragon and Steel pokemons, the first and second types of pokemons with highest average total points, are fifth and fourth rarest in the dataset. The third most powerful type of Pokemons, Psychic, is not so rare in the dataset (but I can assure you the most powerful of them is **extremely** rare).

**IMAGE 2**

Dragon, with an average total point of 541.7600, has highest average attack and special attack points in the dataset with 105.76000 points (which even exceeds Fighting, the type of pokemons designated for fighting, and Psychic, the type of Pokemons with wonderful skills). Steel, on the other hand, has the highest average defense point of 116.61224, which makes them the most defensive type of pokemons in the dataset. Psychic has pretty balanced stats, with an emphasis on average special attack and defense points, as Psychic is known for having wonderful special traits. 

However, being the most powerful type of pokemons doesn't mean Dragon has all the most powerful pokemons in the dataset. Total-point-wise, the 3 most powerful pokemons (with a total point of 780) are MewtwoMega Mewtwo X, MewtwoMega Mewtwo Y and RayquazaMega Rayquaza, with only one of them belongs to Dragon type. The other two are the elvolved states of Mewtwo, a psychic pokemon.
