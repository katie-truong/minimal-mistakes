Interactive plots made by `D3.js`, as useful and exciting as they look, are very daunting for the beginning users. However, recently, I have discovered a more light-weight alternative to `D3`, especially if you are already familiar with `ggplot2`, `plotly`. Although `plotly` can't totally replace `D3` for complicated works (thus `D3` is still a very highly sought after skill), it can do amazing jobs with simple interactive plots. In this post, I will analyze the [Pokemon dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) with 800 different pokemons and use `ggplot2` and `plotly` for interactive visualizations. 

To use `plotly` in R, first you need to follow [this guide](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/) to set up (`plotly` also supports a variety of languages including Python, so feel free to choose the language of your choice).

### Preliminary steps

Using the `str` function for the dataset, we get to know the very clean and straightforward structure of the dataset:

```
str(pokemons_data)

'data.frame':	800 obs. of  11 variables:
 $ X.     : int  1 2 3 3 4 5 6 6 6 7 ...
 $ Name   : Factor w/ 800 levels "Abomasnow","AbomasnowMega Abomasnow",..: 81 330 746 747 103 104 100 101 102 666 ...
 $ Type.1 : Factor w/ 18 levels "Bug","Dark","Dragon",..: 10 10 10 10 7 7 7 7 7 18 ...
 $ Type.2 : Factor w/ 19 levels "","Bug","Dark",..: 15 15 15 15 1 1 9 4 9 1 ...
 $ Total  : int  318 405 525 625 309 405 534 634 634 314 ...
 $ HP     : int  45 60 80 80 39 58 78 78 78 44 ...
 $ Attack : int  49 62 82 100 52 64 84 130 104 48 ...
 $ Defense: int  49 63 83 123 43 58 78 111 78 65 ...
 $ Sp..Atk: int  65 80 100 122 60 80 109 130 159 50 ...
 $ Sp..Def: int  65 80 100 120 50 65 85 85 115 64 ...
 $ Speed  : int  45 60 80 80 65 80 100 100 100 43 ...
 ```
 
 The dataset has 800 rows (yes, 800 different pokemons!) with 11 basic variables including their IDs, names, types, and stats. Looking at the source, each column is explained as followed:
 
 
    #: ID for each pokemon
    Name: Name of each pokemon
    Type 1: Each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks
    Type 2: Some pokemon are dual type and have 2
    Total: sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is
    HP: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting
    Attack: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)
    Defense: the base damage resistance against normal attacks
    SP Atk: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)
    SP Def: the base damage resistance against special attacks
    Speed: determines which pokemon attacks first each round
