After exploring and cleaning the data [here](https://github.com/katie-truong/Jupyter/blob/master/IMDB%20dataset%20-%20Actor%20network%20analysis%20(Part%201).ipynb), we can collect a dataset which consists of 640 collaborations in highly rated movies, and 653 collaborations in lowly rated movies. 

Now what we have to do is to import the csv files into [Gephi](https://gephi.org/). There are a few other tools for network mapping, such as `igraph` in R or `networkx` in Python. However, in this project, I choose to use Gephi because of its diverse usability and design.

# Network of actors in highly rated movies:

The network of actors in highly rated movies is cell-shaped, with collaborations of not-so-famous actors in the edges, and a network of collaborations between Hollywood household names in the center.

There are 178 modularity classes (sub-communities) in the dataset. Most sub-communities have under 5 nodes, however, we can see a handful of sub-communities with more than 15 nodes, which revolves around big household names such as Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, etc... or movie types (superheroes, Western, etc...).

Network of top Hollywood stars. Can you name the movies that they collaborate with each other?

The Superhero Network. Batman, Black Widow and Wolverine are probably linked by [*The Prestige*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/), a movie about magicians. It makes sense, because aren't superheroes magic?

The sizes of the nodes represent their influences in the network ([eigenvector centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector_centrality)). The lead is Tom Hanks (EC = 1), followed closely by Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro in the 0.9 range. Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, Christian Bale and Morgan Freeman are also among the biggest nodes in the network.

However, that leads to the question: Where are the women? 

The actress that has the biggest influence in the network is Kate Winslet with an EC of 0.45079, which is less than half of Tom Hanks. Meryl Streep, the Oscar favorite actress, is second with an EC of 0.376124. Jennifer Lawrence, despite of her impressing track of award winning at a young age, has a mere EC of 0.291412.

Here is a photo of Kate's node next to other similarly influential actresses (and actors!):

And here is Kate's node in comparison with the biggest nodes of (male) actors.

Does the general low EC of the actresses only exist in the highly rated movies? What about the lowly rated ones? We will find out soon!

# Network of actors in lowly rated movies:

Similar to the network of the highly rated movies, the network of lowly rated movies is also cell-shaped.

Here is an overall look at the network.

Very spread-out, I know. Here is a closer look to capture the biggest nodes:

We can notice a few interesting points. 

Firstly, some actors who appear on the highly rated movie lists also appear here. We have Johnny Depp, Matthew McConaughey, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, and of course, Robert De Niro, to name a few. Robert De Niro with an EC of 1 is also the actor with the highest influence in the lowly rated movie list. 

Secondly, the apperance of the actresses with big nodes in the list.

Angelina Jolie Pitt has an EC of 0.59355, which makes her node is the third biggest ones in the list (after Robert De Niro and Dwayne Johnson). Mila Jovovich follows with an EC of 0.5738. Both are higher in comparison with Kate Winslet's EC in the highly rated movie list.

# Conclusion:

- We can say that Tom Hanks and Leo DiCaprio has pretty good tastes in movies. While being the biggest nodes in the highly rated movie list, they are non-existent or has very low influence in the lowly rated list.
- Johnny Depp, Matthew McConaughey, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, etc... have pretty swing tastes in choosing movies. Some of their choices are really good; some are very bad. ~~They could also be in those bad movies for the sake of making money, who knows.~~
- Robert De Niro has extreme [swing taste](http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/best-worst-roles-robert-deniro-sad-career-article-1.2755017) in choosing movies. I still like him nevertheless.
- The actresses tend to have less influence in highly rated movies, and more influence in the lowly rated ones. Why? I still haven't found out.
- Only when I have started writing the conclusion did I realize I didn't weigh in the position of the movies in the lists nor the actual IMDB scores of the movies while mapping the network. An improvement of this analysis should weigh those features in the algorithm.
- The Academy Awards 2017 would be announced tomorrow (2/26/2017). Are Oscar winning and IMDB score correlated? [Maybe, maybe not](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?groups=oscar_best_picture_winners&sort=user_rating%2Casc).

Thank you for reading until the very end!
