Around half a year ago, I picked up JavaScript, first in order to learn `D3.js`. I was (and still am) a fan of fancy graphs, and at one point, `ggplot2`, `matplotlib`, and even Tableau didn't feel enough for me. The thrill to pick up a new language was real. The application of JavaScript, as instant as it was, on web based environments, was exciting. 

It was obvious that I could use JS to do more than just a few fancy graphs. It was obvious that I could use JS for more than just a hobby. I started dreaming about what I could do with my newfound skill. Then I started considering development.

## Me and software engineering

It is not an exaggeration to say that I grew up within a dev circle. In the late 1990s, President Bill Clinton came to Vietnam and normalized the diplomatic relationship between the United States and Vietnam, the first wave of technology came in the country. My dad went back to college to get a degree in "programming", and started working as a programmer for a local company, making very basic softwares at the time. I grew up, never without a company by my side. 

In my high school years, I went to a competitive high school in Vietnam (which actually goes by the name "High School for the Gifted"). I met my best friend, who was (and still is) a passionate programmer. We had late night talks about computers almost every night.

I then moved to the United States, and landed right in the middle of Silicon Valley. Everything and everyone is involved in tech, which I loved. I yearned to work in tech; I yearned to work in life-changing technology and changed the world. 

And somehow, I let development pass by. I came as close as becoming a Computational Statistics major in college, with a bunch of programming and algorimth classes under my belt. I came as close as becoming an analyst in one of the biggest tech companies in the world. But I never believed I could work in development.

Now this is the time to change.

## Where I am today and my goals

As I am writing this post, I am packing up to move to San Francisco for a 13-week immersive coding bootcamp called Hack Reactor. After a thorough and somewhat begrunding process of consideration, weighting pros and cons, many coffee chats and consultations, and reflecting on my own personality, I decided that a structured, stress-invoking, project-based environment among motivated individuals like Hack Reactor is the best way for me to learn right now. 

My goals for the journey I am about to take:

**1. To learn constantly and thoroughly:**

In college, occasionally I would have the mindset to just do the bare minimums in some classes, get a grade, and be over with it. That attitude would be unacceptable on the journey ahead. I genuinely want to learn, to expand and to solidify my knowledge, and become a useful and solid dev.

**2. To be self-aware, but without feeling inferior:**

To acknowledge both my strengths and weaknesses, and enhance and battle them accordingly. Delusions would take me nowhere, but inferiority was the thing that kept me from becoming a dev in the first place.

**3. To be unbreakable:**

The next 13 weeks at Hack Reactor will be really, really tough. The job hunting process after that would be even tougher. My goal is to be unbreakable, by knowing my limits, proper self-care, positive thinking, and knowing when to ask for help.

**4. To be grateful:**

Quitting my job and attending a coding bootcamp was not a decision I made lightly. Thanks Mom and Dad for always supporting my learning process. Thanks everyone who was involved in my decision making process. Thanks Thai for taking the time to explain to me new concepts, or help me fix a bug in my code. Special thanks to everyone who helped me to grow into the person I am today during my time at Google.

**5. To ask for help and to help:**

To know when to ask for help without feeling ashamed. Also be ready to help other people to return the favors to the world, and reinforce what I already have.

## Uncontrollable vs controllable factors

The craziest part is that I know there is a chance I would end up not be able to be a dev after this journey, or 3 months, or 6 months, or a year later. Or I may end up not liking development in the long run (isn't grass always greener on the other side?!). Or I may never reach the skill set or be the type of software engineer that I envison myself to be. Which is fine. I am young and recoverable, and I would be one step closer to knowing exactly what I want to be.

What I know for sure is that I would definitely work my best, learn a ton and make incredible connections during the next few months. What I know for sure is that I would know more, and be a better person than the one I am being right now.

And that's up to me to use what I have and going to have to turn the uncontrollable ones into controllable.
