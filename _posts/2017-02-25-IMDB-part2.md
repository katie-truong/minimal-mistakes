After exploring and cleaning the data [here](https://katie-truong.github.io/IMDB_Part1/), we can collect a dataset which consists of 640 collaborations in highly rated movies, and 653 collaborations in lowly rated movies. 

Now what we have to do is to import the csv files into [Gephi](https://gephi.org/). There are a few other tools for network mapping, such as `igraph` in R or `networkx` in Python. However, in this project, I choose to use Gephi because of its diverse usability and design.

# Network of actors in highly rated movies:

The network of actors in highly rated movies is cell-shaped, with collaborations of not-so-famous actors in the edges, and a network of collaborations between Hollywood household names in the center.

There are 178 modularity classes (sub-communities) in the dataset. Most sub-communities have under 5 nodes, however, we can see a handful of sub-communities with more than 15 nodes, which revolves around big household names such as Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, etc... or movie types (superheroes, Western, etc...).
